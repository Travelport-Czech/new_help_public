# MultiPCC request

This feature allows you to set up, search, and receive offers from multiple markets simultaneously.

The offers are displayed together in a single list and a single currency. Prices reflect fares and availability from multiple countries (e.g., Germany, Austria, Ukraine). The MultiPCC feature fully supports currency conversions and a wide range of settings — including when and where to search in which countries, and statistics of successful searches.

In this section you create profiles for sending requests to PCCs other than the default one set up in the Agency profile.
