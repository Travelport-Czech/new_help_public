# Ticketing in GOL IBE

<!-- tags: ticket, ticketing, e-ticket, auto-ticketing, working hours -->

> **Note:** Automated e-ticketing is only available in the highest version of GOL IBE.

GOL IBE issues tickets **automatically** — there is no manual "Issue ticket" button in the admin console.

## How ticketing works

When a customer completes a booking, a PNR is created in the GDS. The booking status is set to **Active**. Once payment is confirmed and all conditions are met, the ticket is issued automatically and the status changes to **Issued**.

## Working hours protect your ticketing window

GOL IBE uses your configured working hours to prevent customers from creating bookings at times when your agency cannot process e-ticketing. This ensures tickets are always issued within the required deadline.

> Set up working hours under **Agency → Working hours**. See [Set up working hours](/portal/getting-started/1-gol-ibe-2-gol-ibe-step-by-step-gol-ibe-agency-how-to-set-up-working-hours).

## Auto-ticketing via payment gateway

If you use one of the integrated payment gateways, GOL IBE can e-ticket bookings automatically as soon as payment is received — even outside your working hours.

> Automated e-ticketing is available as part of the highest GOL IBE plan. It requires an integrated payment gateway. When both are in place, tickets can be issued automatically after a successful card payment.

See [Auto-ticketing setup](/portal/configuration/basic-auto-ticketing) for configuration details.
